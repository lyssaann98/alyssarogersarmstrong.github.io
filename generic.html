									<h1>About Me<br />
								</header>
								<center>My name is Alyssa Rogers-Armstrong, and I am a 7th grade mathematics teacher, former Math Department Chair, and Team Lead at Francis C. Hammond Middle School in Alexandria City Public Schools (ACPS). I have spent the past several years teaching, leading, and designing data-driven systems that support student learning and equitable resource allocation.</center> <br />
									<br />
									<center>I graduated with my M.A. in Data Analytics & Applied Statistics from Virginia Tech in May 2025. Throughout my graduate program, I completed advanced coursework including Advanced Regression Methods, Experimental Design, Data Analytics, Statistical Learning, Statistical Computing, Communication in Statistics, and Statistics in Research. These courses strengthened my skills in statistical modeling, predictive analytics, data visualization, and communicating complex results to non-technical audiences.</center> <br />
									<br />
										<center>My master’s capstone project, “Exploring English Language Learner Outcomes Through Funding and Staffing Patterns in ACPS,” integrated district-level finance data, demographic data, and school-level performance measures to examine whether resource allocation aligned with student need. This work deepened my commitment to evidence-based decision-making and reinforced my passion for using analytics to address systemic inequities in public education.</center> <br />
									<br />
									<center>In 2023, I was selected for Teach For America’s highly competitive Green Fellowship, which I completed in 2025. This two-year leadership fellowship focused on developing teacher-leaders who drive instructional improvement and equity initiatives. Through the fellowship, I designed and facilitated professional development workshops for new TFA educators, including a multi-part series on data literacy for teachers and using classroom data to inform instruction.</center> <br />
									<br />
									<center>I began my career after graduating from the University of Pittsburgh during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic and joining Teach For America, which accepts only 11–15% of applicants. Over the past four years in ACPS, I have rediscovered my love for mathematics while developing a strong foundation in analytics and leadership. I am committed to bringing both my teaching experience and technical expertise to large-scale, data-driven work that improves school systems.</center> <br />
